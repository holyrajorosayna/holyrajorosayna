I'm holy rajoro and I'm a student at sayna which is a digital school.
I'm interested in code but I'm not a developer.
I'm learning about development and how to learn it.
I'm looking to collaborate in different projects with different methods in the world.
Good luck for me.
my address is: holyrajoro@gmail.com


to the pleasure of exchanging and/ or collaborating together
